# Goodcabs Performance Dashboard ðŸš–

## Overview

The **Goodcabs Performance Dashboard** is an advanced data analysis and visualization application designed to enhance operational excellence for Goodcabs in tier-2 cities across India. Initially, the project began with data analysis and prototyping using **Python Notebooks**, later evolving into a fully functional **Streamlit App** and a robust **FastAPI** backend. This dashboard delivers actionable insights into key performance metrics, helping improve trip volumes, passenger satisfaction, and market positioning.

### Features

1. **City Performance Analysis**:
   - Evaluate city-specific metrics and trends.
   - Identify top and bottom-performing cities.

2. **Demand Analysis**:
   - Analyze demand fluctuations across months and day types.
   - Compare weekday vs. weekend demand.

3. **Passenger Behavior Analysis**:
   - Understand passenger ratings and repeat behaviors.
   - Analyze city-wise repeat passenger frequency.

4. **Target Achievement**:
   - Track performance against monthly trip targets.
   - Categorize results as "Above Target" or "Below Target."

5. **Strategic Insights**:
   - Data-driven recommendations for operational improvements.
   - Emerging trends in mobility and partnership opportunities.
