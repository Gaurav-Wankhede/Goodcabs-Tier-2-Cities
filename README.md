# Goodcabs Performance Dashboard

## What is this project?

The Goodcabs Performance Dashboard is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization tool designed to modernize and enhance the performance tracking of Goodcabs in tier-2 cities. Built using Streamlit and Altair, this application provides in-depth insights into various operational metrics, passenger behaviors, and strategic recommendations to improve service quality and market positioning.

## How does it work?

The dashboard is structured into several key analysis categories:
- **City Performance Analysis**: Evaluates city-specific metrics and trends.
- **Demand Analysis**: Analyzes demand fluctuations and patterns.
- **Passenger Behavior Analysis**: Studies passenger ratings and repeat behavior.
- **Monthly Target Achievement Analysis**: Assesses goal attainment across metrics.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Offers data-driven strategies for improvement.

Each category is equipped with interactive charts, dataframes, and insights, allowing users to explore data dynamically and make informed decisions.

## Installation Steps
